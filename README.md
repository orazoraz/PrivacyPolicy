# PrivacyPolicy

**Last Updated:** August 19, 2025

## Data Collection and Usage

### What Data We Collect
**MivoAi collects NO personal data whatsoever.** Our application operates with a zero-data collection policy:
- We do not collect any personal information
- We do not collect usage data or analytics
- We do not collect device identifiers
- We do not collect location information
- We do not create user profiles or accounts

### How We Collect Data
Since we collect no data, there are no data collection methods employed by our application.

### Data Usage
As no data is collected, there is no data usage by our application or any associated parties.

## Third-Party Data Sharing

### No Third-Party Access
- **Analytics Tools**: We do not use any analytics tools (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- **Advertising Networks**: We do not integrate with any advertising networks
- **Third-Party SDKs**: We do not use any third-party SDKs that collect user data
- **Parent/Subsidiary Companies**: No related organizations have access to user data as none is collected
- **Payment Processors**: Payment data is handled directly by secure processors and never accessed by us

### Third-Party Protection Commitment
Since we collect no user data, there is no data to share with third parties. Any payment processing is handled entirely by certified payment processors who maintain their own privacy and security standards.

## Data Retention and Deletion Policy

### Data Retention
- **Retention Period**: Not applicable - no data is retained
- **Local Data**: Any temporary data created during app use is automatically deleted when the app closes
- **No Server Storage**: We maintain no servers or databases containing user information

### Data Deletion
- **User Request**: Since no data is collected, there is no data to delete upon user request
- **Account Deletion**: No accounts are created, so no account deletion is necessary
- **App Uninstallation**: Uninstalling the app removes any temporary local files

### Consent Withdrawal
Users can withdraw consent at any time by:
- Revoking app permissions in device settings
- Uninstalling the application
- Since no data is collected, withdrawal of consent is immediately effective

## Permissions and User Consent

### Microphone Permission
- **Purpose**: Optional voice input functionality only
- **User Control**: Requested only when user attempts to use voice features
- **Consent Required**: Always requires explicit user permission
- **Withdrawal**: Can be revoked anytime through device settings
- **No Recording**: Audio is processed locally and never recorded or stored
- **Alternative Options**: App functions fully without microphone access

### Clear Permission Descriptions
Our permission request strings clearly state:
- "Microphone access is requested for voice input features only. Audio is processed locally and never recorded or transmitted."

### GDPR Compliance
We do not rely on legitimate interests for data processing as we collect no data. Our app operates without any data collection, ensuring full GDPR compliance.

## Data Minimization

### Minimal Data Approach
- We request access only to essential device features (optional microphone for voice input)
- We collect zero personal information
- We use device-native tools (payment processors) instead of collecting payment information ourselves
- We do not request access to photos, contacts, location, or other sensitive resources

### Alternative Access Methods
- Payment processing uses secure, external processors
- Voice input is entirely optional with manual input alternatives
- No personal information is required for any app functionality

## Account and Login Requirements

### No Account Required
- **Full Functionality**: MivoAi operates completely without user accounts
- **No Login**: No sign-in or registration process exists
- **No Personal Information**: App functions without requiring any personal details
- **No Social Media Integration**: We do not integrate with or require social media accounts

### No Credential Storage
- No user credentials are stored on device or remotely
- No social media tokens or credentials are maintained
- No authentication data is processed or retained

## User Privacy Rights

### Respect for User Settings
- We honor all device permission settings
- We do not attempt to circumvent or manipulate user privacy choices
- We do not repeatedly request denied permissions
- We provide full functionality even when optional permissions are denied

### No Deceptive Practices
- We never collect passwords or personal data covertly
- All app functionality is transparent and clearly explained
- We do not track users without knowledge and consent

### SafariViewController Usage
- When displaying web content, we use SafariViewController appropriately
- Web views are always visible and not hidden behind other interfaces
- We do not use web views for user tracking

## Regulated Services Compliance

### Financial Services
As MivoAi includes payment functionality, this application is submitted by a registered legal entity capable of providing financial services, not an individual developer.

### Geographic Restrictions
Our payment services comply with local financial regulations in all jurisdictions where the app is available.

## Children's Privacy Protection

### No Data Collection from Minors
- We collect no data from users of any age, including children under 13
- No personal information is ever requested from any user
- The app is safe for children as no data collection occurs
